# Kn simulation



## Parameters 

![](bates.gif)

- **D** is determined by the diameter of fuselage.
- **d0** is determined from the consideration of burntime. 
- **L0** is the parameter to determine the profile of Kn. 

## Effect of L0

![](Kn_BATES.png)

- The neutral profile is optimal because it can maintain high Kn during all the range of combustion
- The optimal grain length Lopt is calculated as follows

- For above example (D=24mm, d0=7.2mm), Lopt=39.6mm
